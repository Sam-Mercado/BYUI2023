      <h3>About Me</h3>    
      <p>
        ðŸ‘‹Hey there, This is Sam., Iâ€™m originally from Bolivia. My passion for tech started in 2022 while I was working as a business developer in a SaaS company. I started developing some skills using HTML, CSS, JS, and Python as I was working on some personal projects I noticed the importance of UX UI design and while looking into it I fell in love with the design process.

      </ul>
      <h3>HTML/CSS</h3>
      <p>
        This section will show the skills I developed and what I'm capable of acomplishing, plus solutions to real world problems. 
      </p>
      <p>So in this sectioction of my porfolio I wanto to show you some projects I have worked on using HTML and CSS, most of the websites are responsive so you can test it out in an small screen. 
        each project has buttons that will take you to the website and to the code in github.

      <h3>UX/UI</h3>
      <p>
        This will show visually apeling design projects. This section will be for visitors seeking evidence for creativity and problem-solving skills so they can see how my approach design challenges and create user-friendly solutions.
        The UX/UI design section of my portfolio is where you'll find a curated selection of my design projects presented in an elegant and user-friendly manner. Each project is represented by a thumbnail image, and clicking on them provides access to comprehensive case studies. These case studies offer an in-depth exploration of the design process, challenges faced, creative solutions implemented, and key takeaways.

      <h2>
        Wireframes
      </h2>
      <p>
        Portfolio wireframes of each page of the future websites.
      </p>

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        Once user gets into the website will be able a page title "Hi, my name is Samuel Mercado. Welcome to my portfolio". User will have access to a menu list ("about me", "HTML/CSS or Frontend", "UX UI") followed by links to social media profiles.
      </p>
      <img class="wireframe" src="images/Frame 1.png" alt="home page wireframe">

      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>         
        User will be able to see a description about me and my background, education and work experimental. Nav bar will be at the left side where user will have a different tabs to navegate through the website and the necesary contact information to reach out to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the end of this page the call to action is going to be a button with a "let's connect!" text that is going to take users to my LinkedIn profile. The goal with this is that if we get to connect, the will be able to see my activity in the app, mostly posts of my work, or opinions that I share once in a while ( always material that my contribute to my network) this way I can attempt to grow my personal brand.

        This will show visually appealing design projects.

      </p>
      <p>
        In most of my project I focus on the UI side of the things. Each design has 4 tabs in Figma, one for which are: Lo-fi (for low fidelity prototypes, where the wireframes can be found), Updated Lo-fi ( for updated made after some user interviews testing ), mockup and hi-fi ( for high fidelity prototypes). I will also add some sketches so visitors can see the design process from scratch. In this I'm also adding a "feedback section" or "sent me your opinion" so I can interact with visitors and improve my designs according to the experience the have had while navigating through the prototypes.
      </p>

      <h3>HTML/CSS</h3>
      <p>         
        As the previous page this is going to show users all projects each project will content a title, description, and buttons one for GitHub and one for website. User will be able to scroll down to see more projects.NAV bar will be at the left side and contact information is ging to be there, either way I want to ad a call to action button at the end of this page so visitors can write some feedback or recommendations, It would also help me to interact with people that visited the website.
      </p>
      <p>
        My vison for this page is to start adding projects with bootstrap, Java Scrip and Python. So I might have to change the tab name.
